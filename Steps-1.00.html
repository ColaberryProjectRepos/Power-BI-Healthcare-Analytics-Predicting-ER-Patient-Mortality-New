1
<div>Emergency rooms are high-pressure environments where quick decisions can save lives. This project leverages predictive analytics to identify high-risk patients based on age, health scores, wait times, and medical conditions. By analyzing historical ER data, the model helps prioritize critical cases, reducing delays and improving survival rates. The interactive dashboard visualizes key patient metrics, mortality trends, and referral patterns for data-driven decision-making. Insights from this analysis enable hospitals to enhance efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient outcomes. With real-time predictions, healthcare providers can intervene earlier, ultimately saving more lives. This project showcases how advanced analytics can transform emergency care.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/13/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><div><br></div><div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Background</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Emergency rooms (ERs) operate in fast-paced, high-pressure settings where rapid decision-making is crucial for saving lives. However, challenges such as fluctuating mortality rates, long wait times, and limited resources complicate patient prioritization. Conventional triage methods may not always detect high-risk patients effectively, resulting in delays in urgent care. By utilizing predictive analytics, ERs can analyze real-time and historical data to optimize decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/13/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Objectives&nbsp;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>To utilize predictive analytics to identify high-risk ER patients, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. By analyzing historical patient data, the project aims to reduce wait times and optimize resource allocation.

Limited resources and high patient influx make prioritization difficult, impacting hospital efficiency and survival outcomes. High mortality and readmission rates highlight gaps in timely interventions and follow-up care, while varying wait times across departments affect treatment effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The absence of predictive insights on patient risk factors hinders proactive decision-making and resource allocation. To address these issues, a data-driven approach is essential for analyzing historical ER data, predicting mortality risks, and optimizing emergency care strategies to improve patient outcomes.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/2/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></div></div></div>
