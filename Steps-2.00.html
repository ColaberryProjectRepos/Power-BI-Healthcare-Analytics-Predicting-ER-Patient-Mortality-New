<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Data Sources</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">The data used for this analysis was sourced from Data.world.
The dataset, titled&nbsp;<i>Hospital ER.csv</i>, contains information on
patient outcomes—such as whether a patient survived or died—as well as
associated health conditions, including infection rates, readmission rates,
patient satisfaction, and improvement in health condition. The data spans from
2019 to 2020 and was designed to reflect typical hospital ER operations for use
in predictive modeling and performance analysis.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/26/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>System Architecture</b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">

</p><p class="MsoNormal">The architecture focuses on improving emergency care by
analyzing patient data and predicting mortality risks. It involves gathering
historical ER patient records, preprocessing and cleansing the data, selecting
key health metrics, applying predictive modeling techniques using Python, and
visualizing insights in Power BI. This system enables data-driven
decision-making to enhance patient outcomes and optimize emergency response
strategies.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/26/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Data Features</b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">

</p><p class="MsoNormal">The dataset includes variables such as mortality rate,
patient gender, age, satisfaction score, wait time, department referral,
infection rate, and readmission rate, which are critical for predicting ER
patient outcomes, improving emergency response strategies, and optimizing
healthcare resource allocation across different departments and timeframes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/26/3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
