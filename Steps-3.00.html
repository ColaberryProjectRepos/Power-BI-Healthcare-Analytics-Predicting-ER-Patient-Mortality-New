<div><b>Data Preparation</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The data was cleaned by identifying and removing duplicates, handling missing values, filtering outliers, and standardizing the dataset to ensure consistency and reliability. These steps were crucial in preparing the data for analyzing mortality rates, patient demographics, wait times, infection rates, and readmission risks, ultimately supporting accurate predictions and insights into ER patient outcomes.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/11/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Model Selection</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The <b>ExtraTreeClassifier</b> was selected for its effectiveness in predicting ER patient mortality using both numerical and categorical health indicators. This model demonstrated strong performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, effectively capturing patterns related to mortality rates, patient demographics, wait times, infection rates, and readmission risks. Its ability to handle complex interactions between variables makes it well-suited for healthcare predictive analytics.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/11/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Model Development</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The ExtraTreeClassifier was trained on historical ER patient data using a training-testing split. The training set allowed the model to identify key patterns in mortality rates, patient demographics, wait times, infection rates, and readmission risks, while the testing set ensured reliable predictions on unseen data. This approach helped maintain accuracy, generalization, and robustness in predicting ER patient outcomes.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/11/3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></div></div></div>
