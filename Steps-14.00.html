<p>This step explains how to create measures, as demonstrated in the screenshot below</p><p><img src = "https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/15/4.jpg" /><br></p><p>1. First create a placeholder which holds all measures. To create a measures placeholder, go to "Table Tools," click "New Table," and enter the following formula:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">This creates a placeholder table for organizing and managing all ER-related measures.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">ERMeasures = { "Placeholder" }</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;2. Then create measures.&nbsp;</span>To create a measure, click the three dots on the right side of the "ERMeasures" placeholder, select "New Measure," and enter the following DAX formulas:</p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">MortalityRate % = DIVIDE( COUNTROWS(FILTER(EmergencyPatientsDataset, EmergencyPatientsDataset[mortality_rate] = "Yes")), [TotalPatients] )</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">3. Create all remaining measures using the same process described above. Iâ€™ve included a ZIP file containing all the DAX formulas for reference.&nbsp;</span>Follow the GIF below for detailed instruction to create measures.&nbsp;<img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/3/1.gif"></p><p>4. Make sure to change the data format of all percentage measures to "Percentage" for correct representation.&nbsp;</p><p>5. To do this: select the measure in the Fields pane, go to the "Measure tools" tab.&nbsp;</p><p>6. In the "Formatting" section, change the data type to Percentage and set the desired number of decimal places as shown below.&nbsp;<img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1596/3/2.gif"></p>
